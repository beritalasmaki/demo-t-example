# Decisions

A record of choices where there was a real trade-off. Newest first.

Each entry has four parts: the situation, the options, the choice, and what it means going forward.

## 0004 · `DecisionInput` carries `by`, not just what changed

**Context.** `submitDecision(runId, decision)` needs to know who is deciding. A real backend
would read that from an authenticated session, never from the request body, so the client
would not need to send it.

**Options.** (a) Add a third `reviewer` parameter to `submitDecision`. (b) Put `by` on
`DecisionInput` itself. (c) Wait until there is a real backend to decide this.

**Choice.** (b), because there is no session to read it from yet, and the task that asked for
this API specified an exact two-argument signature.

**Consequence.** `by` on `DecisionInput` is a stand-in for auth, not a design to keep: once a
real backend exists, it should read the reviewer from the session and this field should come
out. `at`, by contrast, is set by `lib/api.ts` itself, not taken from the input — a client
should not get to say when its own request happened.

## 0003 · The undo window is a policy, not a stored field

**Context.** The spec's data model has no field for the undo window it describes elsewhere
(Region 6, "Hierarchy and disclosure", "Acceptance criteria" all mention a counting-down undo
window after a decision), and `docs/spec-review-screen.md` gives one concrete number: "You can
undo this for 10 minutes."

**Options.** (a) Add `undoableUntil` (or similar) to `Decision`, set once at decision time.
(b) Treat the window as a fixed duration computed from `Decision.at`, not stored at all.

**Choice.** (b). It matches the one number the spec actually gives, and it means "use the data
model there" (this task's own instruction) holds literally — no field was added to `Decision`.

**Consequence.** The window length lives wherever it is computed (for now, a comment in
`src/fixtures/run-messy.ts`), not in the type. If a real system ever needs the window to vary
by risk or environment, that is the point to add the field back — a single global constant
does not fit that case.

## 0002 · The design system stays inside the app, for now

**Context.** `components/` and `styles/` together are the design system. The obvious
alternative is to publish them as separate packages, which is how a platform that lets AI
agents consume design standards would eventually do it.

**Options.** (a) Monorepo with `packages/ui` and `packages/tokens` from day one.
(b) Keep one app, but write the design system so it can be extracted later.

**Choice.** (b). One screen does not justify the build and release machinery of (a).

**Consequence.** The boundary has to be enforced by discipline instead of package limits:
`components/` and `styles/` never import from `features/` or `fixtures/`, and never contain
product concepts. An ESLint import rule guards this.

## 0001 · Light theme is the default

**Context.** The reviewer in this product is often a compliance or security person working
in bright, document-heavy environments, next to spreadsheets and PDFs.

**Options.** (a) Dark default, like most developer tools. (b) Light default, dark available.
(c) Follow the system setting only.

**Choice.** Light default, dark available, system preference respected on first load.

**Consequence.** Every component has to be designed twice, and tokens must be semantic
from day one. It also means the screenshots look unlike the usual dark AI-tool UI, which is
intentional.
