/**
 * The welcome intro's once-per-visit logic and timing (WelcomeIntro.tsx, docs/DECISIONS.md
 * 0048 and 0049). A visit is a browser session: the intro plays again whenever someone opens
 * the site in a new tab or window, or comes back after closing it — but not on the page loads
 * inside one visit (the breadcrumb and "My reviews" links reload the page).
 * Kept apart from the component so `App.tsx` can decide whether to show it without importing
 * the whole overlay's markup, and so the component file exports components only.
